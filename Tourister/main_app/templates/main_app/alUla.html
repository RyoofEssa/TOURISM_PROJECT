                            <h2 class="mb-3">AlUla - A lively destination that combines nature, heritage, and arts in the heart of the lush oasis.</h2>
                            <p>There are few places in the world where you can still feel like a true explorer charting the unknown. In many historic destinations, the illusion of discovery is promptly shattered by a jungle of selfie sticks. But in AlUla, which is home to Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, deep in the desert in the northwestern region of the country, you might still be able to play out your fantasy of being an intrepid archaeologist for a day. Despite all the makings of a bucket list-topping global destination — ancient tombs that remain as the legacy of 7,000 years of human civilisation, stunning natural rock formations and canyons, a plethora of adventure sports options and cutting-edge art installations — AlUla remains largely off the global tourism radar, giving you plenty of space and time for reflection with the monumentality of its beautiful desert landscapes. </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-3">UNCOVER THE HISTORY</h4>
                            <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="{%static 'image/alula4.jpeg'%}">
                            <p>For thousands of years, northwest Saudi Arabia attracted people who came to take advantage of the abundant resources offered by its fertile oases.
                                AlUla was one of them, and became a vital crossroads along the famous incense-trading routes running from southern Arabia, north into Egypt, and beyond. With oases dotting the area, it offered a much-needed respite for weary travellers, becoming a popular place to rest, commune and recharge.
                                AlUla was also capital of the ancient kingdoms of Dadan and Lihyan, which controlled the caravan trade. Hegra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the principal southern city of the Nabataean kingdom, famed for its spectacular monumental tombs. Today, Old Town AlUla is an abandoned labyrinth of streets tightly packed to create a defensive wall, and seemingly built over an ancient settlement.
                                This largely undiscovered expanse holds a timeless mystery that has been carried through its complex history. Layer upon layer of human history and a wealth of natural wonders are waiting to be explored, from dramatic rock formations and sand-swept dunes to archaeological ruins that trace the lives of the ancient cultures who built cities here.
                                Soon, this land will be yours to discover.</p>
